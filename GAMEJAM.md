🎭 Theme
    
    Light is dangerous

💡 Game Idea
    
    The player is a shadow which got seperated from its host due to a bomb going off.
    The player will be trying to catch its host while trying to avoid the light.
    The player can't touch the light since a shadow without a source doesn't exist.
    The player's host body will start burning, like the people without their shadows
    in Thriller Bark from One Piece, so a time limit is present.
